# Edgestore Integration & Resizable Layout Demo

This project is a dedicated technical demonstration built in Next.js, featuring a clean, two-column, resizable user interface for file management using Edgestore.dev for storage and URL retrieval.

The primary goal of this application was to replicate the exact visual layout provided while demonstrating secure, efficient cloud file handling.

## üöÄ Features & Technical Highlights

**Edgestore Integration:** Fully integrated with Edgestore.dev to handle the entire file upload lifecycle, from selection to secure storage and URL generation.

**Two-Column Layout:** Implements a precise two-column design, with distinct sections for the upload form and the download/URL display.

**Resizable Blocks:** The application uses modern CSS techniques to ensure the content blocks are fully responsive and resizable, honoring the requirement for flexible workspace viewing.

**Aesthetic & Components:** Built using shadcn/ui components for a highly polished, accessible, and production-ready user interface.

**Rapid Development:** This proof-of-concept was developed and delivered within the strict 24-hour deadline.

**Secure URL Display:** Once uploaded, the direct, secure URL for the file is immediately displayed, allowing for quick sharing or downloading.
